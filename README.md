# subtypeANN
Python script to train ANNs from HIV-1 subtype reference sequences. The python code for neural network design has been modified from the original repository  [neural-networks-and-deep-learning](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) containing sample codes from the book by [Michael Nielsen] (http://michaelnielsen.org/).
