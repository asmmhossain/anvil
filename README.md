# ANVIL
Artificial neural Networks for VIral Lineages (ANVIL) is a Python based subtype analyser program. Neural networks are trained using subtype-specific reference sequences. Subtypes are assigned by calculating subtype-specific likelihoods that are screened using a decision tree approach. Potential recombinant sequences undergo an additional breakpoint analysis step. The python code for neural network design has been modified from the original repository  [neural-networks-and-deep-learning](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) containing sample codes from the book by [Michael Nielsen] (http://michaelnielsen.org/).
